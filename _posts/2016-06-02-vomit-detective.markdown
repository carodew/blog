Last night I separated Irma from the other two cats by shutting her in the office in an effort to try to see if she is the one who has vomited the past two nights in a row. If it is her, it probably warrants another trip to the vet. If it's Dori I may be able to solve the problem by the careful switching around of food. I doubt it's Jerome. 

Separating Irma into the office overnight involved not just setting up separate food and water bowls in the office but also switching out the top-loading litter box in the office closet, with the side-loading one that's normally in the laundry room. Irma doesn't have the strength in her hind legs hop in and out of the top-loader anymore. 

When I got up this morning there was no vomit anywhere. The mystery continues.

I'm starting this blog because I hope I can contribute something meaningful. Or maybe I can discover some things about myself and what I do, or why I do it. But I want to lay some ground rules for myself to try to keep some type of focus. 

I'm diagnosed with major depression, and I intend to talk about mental health here and my own experiences with it but I don't plan on using the diagnostic term that frequently. But I'm putting it here because I'm not ashamed of it, and I don't want to give that impression. 

I don't want to use that term in writing because I don't want to get lazy in my writing. It is a shorthand way of describing a pattern of symptoms, but it doesn't express itself in the same way in everyone and no one is entirely sure what causes it. Plus, there is a lot of misunderstanding of what it is. People have a tendency to both minimize ("just get out and exercise") and demonize it (as in the case of a mentally ill person who acts out violently). I hope that by sharing my experience of it I can help dispel misconceptions on both sides. 

But I also don't want to use the diagnosis because while I want to write about my experience, it's really the experience of a person first and foremost, and I hope there is more to me that a person without an emotional disorder can relate to than that which they cannot. There is a touch of depression in everyone. Some of us just get served extra helpings.

I also want to talk about my experience in therapy. I've encouraged so many people to try therapy but it seems to have a dark cloud of mystery (and stigma) (and cost) surrounding it that very few people ever take that step. Therapy has been the most profound undertaking of my life, my life is uncomprehendingly better because of it. I escaped a blindness and numbness that had the power to keep me trapped forever. I still struggle with it, but at least I know to struggle. 

I will try not to indulge too much in self pity (although I am prone to it) but I would be lying if I claimed to have a particularly sunny disposition. I don't apologize for this. We overemphasize happiness and gaiety in American culture and ignore our shadow sides, which I think is a mistake. Not everything can be solved in six easy steps, and the stuff that can be generally won't make you a fulfilled person.
